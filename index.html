     <h4 class="h2-color">about</h4>
     <p>
        Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.<br>
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.<br>
         Designers are toolmakers.<br>
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.<br>
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.<br>
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.<br>
